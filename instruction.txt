Create a complete web app that accepts a query and updates a spreadsheet of the result.

The app should have the following features:

1. Accept a search query from the user e.g: "restaurants in New York".
2. Use the Google serp API to search for the query.
3. Update a spreadsheet with the results.

The spreadsheet should have the following columns (not all columns are required):

name, address, city, state, country, phone number, website, rating, number of reviews, google place id, latitude, longitude, images, opening hours, price level, 

The api should allow pagination so that it can fetch results in chunks of 100s. avoid duplicate by their place id.
